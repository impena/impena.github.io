# About Me
## My Interests
1. Programming:
  _I am a complete beginner but I enjoy messing around with small projects._
2. Chess:
   _I originally learned how to play in a chess club and now occasionally play online._
3. Knitting:
   _I'm a novice knitter that enjoys small projects like making scarves and decorations. I'm currently working on a tote bag._
## Websites I Recommend
- [Khan Academy] (https://www.khanacademy.org) - This website offers educational videos and articles on so many topics, from math to science to grammar to programming. There is so much content and it's all for free and run by a non profit organization. My personal favorite courses are the programming ones which include an interactive environment where you can learn Javascript and SQL.
- [Type Racer] (https://play.typeracer.com) - This free website teaches you how to type quickly, measuring how quickly you type and turning it into a game where you compete with other "racers" to type the quickest. It brought my typing speed from 45wpm to about 71wpm.
